# Book Management System - MERN Project

This is my first full-stack MERN project: a Book Management System that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Authorized users can add new books, edit book details, update information, or delete books.

## Features

- Add, edit, update, and delete books (CRUD operations)
- JWT-based authentication for secure access
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for building the RESTful API
- **MongoDB** as the database
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB object modeling
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing (if authentication includes login)

### Frontend

- **React.js** for building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Material-UI** components for enhanced UI/UX
- **React Font Awesome** for icons

## Project Structure

- **Backend:**`backend/` folder with API routes, controllers, and models
- **Frontend:** `frontend/` folder with React components, pages, and styles

## Purpose

This project focuses on demonstrating practical knowledge of the MERN stack, handling authentication with JWT, and implementing full CRUD operations in a secure and responsive web application.
